what is switch case in c ?
--> Switch case is a control statement in C that allows multi-way branching. It evaluates an expression and executes the corresponding case block based on the value of the expression. It is often used as an alternative to multiple if-else statements when there are many conditions to check against a single variable. The switch statement can improve code readability and organization.
