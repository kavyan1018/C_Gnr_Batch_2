--> 1. Introduction of C

in 1972 C was developed by Dennis Ritchie 

at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system.

2. C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.


1. High level language -> C, C++, JAVA, Python 
2. Low level language -> Assembly language, Machine language(binary code)


computer -> hardware + software

hardware -> physical components of computer
software -> set of instructions that tells the computer what to do

how to convert the high level language to low level language?
compiler -> converts the high level language to low level language
Example: C -> compiler -> Assembly language -> compiler -> Machine language
-> it will convert the whole code at once


interpreter -> converts the high level language to low level language line by line
Example: C -> interpreter -> Assembly language -> interpreter -> Machine language
-> it will convert the code line by line



what ia the Assembly language?
-> Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to write programs that are executed by the computer's CPU.


what is the Machine language?
-> Machine language is the lowest-level programming language, except for computers that utilize programmable microcode and are only understood by computers.

ASCII VALUES -> American Standard Code for Information Interchange

A -> 65
B -> 66

a -> 97


how to convert the decimal value to Binary value?
in image d to b 

Rules for Decimal to Binary Conversion :
1. Divide the number by 2.
2. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
3. Get the remainder for the binary digit.
4. Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0.

Example: Decimal to Binary Conversion

234
234/2 -> 117 -> 0
117/2 -> 58 -> 1
58/2 -> 29 -> 0
29/2 -> 14 -> 1
14/2 -> 7 -> 0
7/2 -> 3 -> 1
3/2 -> 1 -> 1
1/2 -> 0 -> 1

what is data type?
-> A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.


threre is total 2 types of data types
1. Primitive data types -> in built data types
-> int :- 2 bytes -> 123456  =>  limit +32767 and -32768
-> float :- 4 bytes -> 123.456 -> 6 decimal places
-> char :- 1 byte -> 'A' -> 1 character 
-> double :- 8 bytes -> 123.456 -> 15 decimal places
-> long :- 4 bytes -> 123456 ->  limit +2147483647 and -2147483648

2. Non Primitive data types
-> Derived data types :- array, function, pointer
-> user defined data types :- structure, union, 


-> int   :- int a = 10; u can store the integer value
-> float :- float b = 10.5; u can store the decimal value
-> char  :- char c = 'A'; u can store the character value
-> double:- double d = 10.5; u can store the decimal value
-> long  :- long e = 123456; u can store the integer value
